    <h2>About PetHouse</h2>
    <p>PetHouse is a simple and friendly platform created to help people find loving pets. We aim to connect pets with caring families.Our mission is to connect abandoned, rescued, or homeless animals with kind-hearted families who can give them a safe and loving home.

At PetHouse, we believe that every pet deserves a second chance. Many dogs, cats, and other animals end up on the streets or in shelters because of circumstances they never asked for. We work with local shelters, student volunteers, and rescuers to ensure that these pets receive proper care until they find their forever family.

<br>We are committed to:<br>

<br>Providing transparent and reliable adoption details

<br>Showcasing pets with accurate information

<br>Promoting responsible pet ownership

<br>Creating awareness about pet care

Supporting animal rescue initiatives
Our Objectives:<br>

✓ Provide a simple and interactive interface for viewing adoptable pets<br>
✓ Educate people about the benefits of adopting over buying<br>
✓ Support shelters and rescue groups<br>
✓ Promote responsible ownership practices<br>
✓ Encourage compassion and empathy.<br>

Every adoption you make changes a life — not only for the pet but for you as well.
Adopt a pet. Save a life. Spread love.<br>
